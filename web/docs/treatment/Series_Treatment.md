## Series Treatment — The Dreamteam Chronicles: Festival of Shadows (Firedog Edition)

Refer to `Dreamteam_Master_Dossier.md` for the consolidated overview. This treatment captures the 5-issue arc with the beer reveal in Issue #1, retaining ambiguity, and integrating storm, silent disco, food trucks, hammocks, vendor pop-ups, and the Man in Red as catalyst.

### Series Premise
A 20-friend convoy spends five days at Firedog Festival in The Woodlands, Delaware. The official biergarten beer appears to corrupt attendees while a flamboyant Red Guy’s LSD reveals an uncanny layer of reality to the five-person Dreamteam. The team must neutralize the biergarten’s influence and still make Paul McCartney’s closing set.

- Issue 1: Arrival; storm; biergarten beer is revealed as the threat by the end of the issue; Red Guy cameo; Nicole disappears.
- Issue 2: LSD from Red Guy; initial illusions; small conflicts; communication barriers; Matt’s normal lens.
- Issue 3: Telepathy among trippers; Nicole returns; biergarten stakeout; illusions vs. sober POV.
