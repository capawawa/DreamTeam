## Setting — Firedog Festival (The Woodlands, Delaware, June)

- Storm night: heavy wind/rain; tents flying; muddy grounds; car shelter.
- Activities: multi-stage music (EDM/rock/rap/jam), silent disco, food trucks, hammock zones, vendor pop-ups.
- Biergarten: single official alcohol vendor; outside alcohol not allowed; suspected source of corruption.
- Opening visuals: festival map, setlist, group photo, convoy arrival.

### Location Notes
- The Woodlands (near Delaware college campus), June humidity; tree lines break up sightlines; thicket path for first-night walk.

### Stage Ecology (for beats/art)
- Main Stage: Day 5 finale (Paul McCartney). Crowd flow from biergarten.
- Stage B/C: Mid-size sets; useful for ambushes/illusions; strobe-rich night scenes.
- Jam Tent: Dani-aligned calmer sequences; de-escalation moments.

### Traffic & Flow
- Morning: yoga mentions (not attended), food trucks as regroup hubs.
- Afternoon: vendor/brand pop-ups for comedic transitions and clues.
- Night: silent disco oddities; deniable illusions dial up.
