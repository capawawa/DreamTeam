## Festival Missions — From Original Notes

- Destroy/neutralize corrupted elements:
  - Poisoned beer (biergarten supply)
  - Breweries/beer gardens
  - "Shitty acts" controlled by evil
- Corral objective:
  - "We have to get most of the drunk people trapped in the Biergarten" — used as containment to reduce harm and break the spread.
- Save friends and fans; protect access to key sets (end goal: see Paul McCartney).
