## Issue 04 — Beat Sheet (Descent into Drunken Chaos)
- Opening: festival-wide escalation; cheap beer push.
- Mid: attempt sabotage/infiltration; strobe-lit muddy clash.
- Strain: friendships tested; storm residue complicates movement.
- Cliffhanger: vow to stop it at Paul’s set.
 - Note: execute partial corral — herd drunk attendees toward biergarten perimeter.
