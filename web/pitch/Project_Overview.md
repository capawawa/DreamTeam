### One-Pager (Concise)
- Title: The Dreamteam Chronicles: Festival of Shadows (Firedog Edition)
- Premise: A five-person crew within a 20-friend convoy uncovers a corrupted biergarten beer at a massive Delaware festival. An enigmatic Red Guy’s LSD reveals a warped layer of reality—maybe supernatural, maybe not. Across storms, silent discos, and stage battles, they fight to save the festival and still catch Paul McCartney.
- Tone: Scott Pilgrim energy + psychedelic overlays; ambiguous horror; comedic festival satire.
- Why Now: Festival culture is mainstream; mashups of comedy + light horror are popular; strong visual identity.
- Ask: Co-writer/artist collaboration; sample pages; light budget to produce Issue #1.
