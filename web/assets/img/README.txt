This folder holds tiny badges or image assets for the 90s site.

Current implementation uses inline base64 placeholders inside CSS (retro.css) for:
- Starfield tile
- Clouds tile
- "NEW" micro badge

If you later swap to real images, drop small GIF/PNG files here and reference them from CSS/HTML with relative paths like:
  ../assets/img/under_construction.gif
