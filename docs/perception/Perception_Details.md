## Perception Details — From Original Notes

- Night one Molly water in the thicket triggers perception shift: see what is happening to the people and the true nature of staff/surroundings.
- Specific lines captured:
  - "We saw Molly kids as monsters and ourselves as amazing." (Note: preserve tension with later canon stating psychedelics reveal true/magical selves.)
  - "Saw the mad hatter as magical."
  - "Saw the drugs as powerful and maybe they were."
- General rule from notes: everything looks normal until drugs taken; then:
  - People on drugs: true self, magical creatures/caricatures.
  - Sober: normal.
  - Alcohol (festival beer): zombies.

### Reconciliation Guidance
- Maintain both statements as perspective snapshots: initial Molly night may distort peer groups ("Molly kids as monsters") before rules stabilize via Greg’s LSD insight.
- Use panel tags and captions to indicate evolving understanding across issues.
