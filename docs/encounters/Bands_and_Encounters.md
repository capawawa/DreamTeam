## Bands and Encounters — From Original Notes

- "We meet bands along the way that help us; some get killed; sell-outs are already mind controlled."
  - Canon handling: avoid on-panel death graphic; can imply disappearances or mind-control outcomes; keep ambiguous.
- Other people on psychedelics or different drugs: help, hinder, or simply appear as characters/creatures when high.
- Mad Hatter: perceived as magical during trip.
