## Canon Rules — Perception, Communication, Ambiguity

- Perception while high:
  - Psychedelics: people appear magical/caricatured (“true self”).
  - Sober: appear normal.
  - Festival beer drunk: appear as zombies/monsters.
- Communication while high:
  - Can communicate almost psychically with other high people.
  - Cannot communicate with sober or drunk people — exceptions: vendors/cashiers behind counters and Matt.
- Telepathy: near-psychic coordination among trippers; used for rescue/strategy/comedy.
- Ambiguity:
  - No omniscient villain scenes; all evil filtered through Dreamteam’s POV.
  - Fleeting “behind-the-scenes” glimpses must remain interpretable as real or hallucination.

### Implementation Notes (for scripts/art)
- POV Switches:
  - Dreamteam POV: trippy overlays, stylized eyes/ooze effects, warped panel borders.
  - Matt POV: clean lines, normal palettes, no distortions.
- Vendors Exception:
  - Dialogue with vendors/cashiers renders normally even when characters are high.
- Biergarten Illusions:
  - Any keg/eye/ooze motif should always be deniable via a Matt POV beat within 1–2 pages.
