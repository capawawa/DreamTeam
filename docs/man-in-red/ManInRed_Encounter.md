## First Encounter — Business Card Only

- From notes: "Magic guy with a red jacket red hat curly mustache and cane came by and gave us a business card we don’t see him just the business card."
- Follow-up: calling the card → "Be careful, this is 100% pure"; tested with kit → pure black (100% purity).
- Canon: keep physical presence minimal in first beat; emphasize disappearance and card as artifact.
