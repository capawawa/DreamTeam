# DreamTeam Research Inventory and Synthesis

Purpose
- Single-source research brief for a 5-issue comic miniseries “The Dreamteam Chronicles: Festival of Shadows (Firedog Edition)”.
- Focus: inventory, synthesis, continuity guardrails, POV/ambiguity discipline, mission scaffolding, production/legal pointers, and gaps that need decisions.
- Citations use clickable filename references per MARKDOWN RULES.

1) Executive Overview
- Core premise: A 20-friend convoy attends the 5-day Firedog Festival in Delaware; the biergarten’s official beer appears corrupted, while an enigmatic “Man in Red” provides LSD that lets the five-member Dreamteam perceive a trippy/“true” layer of reality. They must neutralize the biergarten’s influence, protect friends, navigate storms/chaos, and still reach Paul McCartney’s finale set. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:1-16)
- Five-issue spine (condensed):
  - Issue 1: Arrival; storm; biergarten beer revealed as threat; Red Guy (Man in Red) cameo; Nicole disappears. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
  - Issue 2: Red Guy’s LSD; initial illusions; small conflicts; comms barriers; Matt’s normal lens. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
  - Issue 3: Telepathy among trippers; Nicole returns; biergarten stakeout; illusions vs. sober POV. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
  - Issue 4: Festival-wide chaos; strobe-lit confrontation; friendships strained. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
  - Issue 5: Paul’s set; telepathic “positive wave”; Matt accidental assist; ambiguous resolution; Red Guy exits. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
- Materials envisioned/centralized in the merged “Bible” page: overview/pitch, treatment, narrative structure, setting, canon/perception, characters, Man in Red, missions, encounters, beat sheets, script format, Issue 1 sample, extras plan, production plan, legal template, and a consolidated dossier. ["index.html"](web/index.html)

2) Canon and Lore Backbone (Non‑negotiables)
- Perception tiers:
  - Dreamteam on psychedelics: sees stylized overlays/“true selves” and detects corrupted cues (never gore; keep ambiguously readable). Confirmed via Issue #1 sample visuals (trippy overlays) and treatment summary. ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:16-25), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:97-106), ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:1-16)
  - Matt POV: clean, normal rendering. ["Comic_Script_Format.md"](scripts/format/Comic_Script_Format.md:10-13), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:86-95), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:121-124)
- Communication/exception rules (as currently applied):
  - Telepathic/heightened coordination among trippers emerges by Issue 3; vendors/cashiers speak normally even when Dreamteam is altered; Matt can communicate normally. Confirmed beats: vendor line interaction is plain speech while Dreamteam aside notes the exception. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:61-74)
- Ambiguity discipline:
  - No omniscient villain scenes; any behind-the-scenes visual must be reinterpretable within 1–2 pages (pair with a normal POV cue). Maintain deniable readings of corruption vs. mass intoxication/mania per treatment tone and POV convention guide. ["Comic_Script_Format.md"](scripts/format/Comic_Script_Format.md:10-13), ["index.html"](web/index.html)
- Antagonistic vector:
  - Biergarten beer as the apparent threat; corrupted elements include beer supply, certain brewery adjacencies, and possibly “shitty acts” influenced by the same force. ["Festival_Missions.md"](docs/missions/Festival_Missions.md:1-11), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:125-134)

3) World and Setting (Firedog)
- Locale: The Woodlands, Delaware; festival macro-areas—campsites, food trucks, silent disco, hammocks, thicket path, biergarten, main stages. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:1-16), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:61-74)
- Environment: Storm systems, mud, night lighting, strobe-y confrontation spaces; capacity crowds and crowd flow considerations are relevant for later issues and maps. ["index.html"](web/index.html)
- Suggest consulting/expanding setting references in ["Firedog_Setting.md"](docs/setting/Firedog_Setting.md) for geography granularity.

4) Characters (Core Five, Nicole, Matt, Ensemble)
- Core Dreamteam (Adam, Sam, Dani, Greg, Nick): functions and dynamic are visible through sample pages—Adam voice captioning, Sam’s pragmatic/logistical push, Dani’s sensing/intuition, Greg’s pattern recognition/resolve, Nick’s comedic ballast. ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:3-13), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:27-38), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:51-60)
- Nicole: missing-persons thread launched in Issue 1 (vanishes early, returns by Issue 3 per plan). ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:97-106)
- Matt: sober/normal lens cameo beats; becomes structural anchor for deniability and later assists during the finale. ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:83-95), ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
- For deeper bios, arcs, and dos/don’ts, cross-reference ["Character_Bible.md"](docs/characters/Character_Bible.md).

5) Antagonists and Encounters
- Man in Red (Red Guy): catalyst and chaos agent; provides LSD, drops cryptic cues; appears in Issue 1 via calling card/rain imagery; exits at the end of Issue 5 per plan. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:10-13), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:108-114), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:129-134)
- Corrupted elements: biergarten supply; possibly adjacent brewery zones and acts “controlled by evil.” Treatment retains ambiguity around literal supernatural vs. mass intoxication/psychosocial overlays. ["Festival_Missions.md"](docs/missions/Festival_Missions.md:1-11)
- Encounter taxonomy to formalize: biergarten perimeter collapses, strobe-lit confrontations, staffer “flicker” beats, crowd telepathy wave, vendor exception interactions, silent disco anomalies. ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:61-74), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:115-124)

6) Theme, Tone, Audience
- Themes: friendship amid chaos; perception vs. reality; communal music energy; ambiguity-as-feature. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:15-16)
- Tonal mix: comedic festival satire + light/ambiguous horror + psychedelic visual identity (Scott-Pilgrim-esque energy with trippy overlays; not splatter/gore). ["index.html"](web/index.html)
- Audience: readers who enjoy music-culture adventures with genre mash, humor, and stylish POV experiments. ["index.html"](web/index.html)

7) Narrative Architecture (“Two stories, one book”)
- Structural principle: interleave autobiographical festival comedy with superhero-psychedelic escalation; POV toggles enforce the ambiguity engine (Dreamteam trippy vs. Matt clean). ["Comic_Script_Format.md"](scripts/format/Comic_Script_Format.md:10-13)
- Continuity dependencies by issue:
  - I1: Launch beer threat, seed Red Guy, trigger Nicole vanish, establish POV contract. ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:125-134), ["Comic_Script_Format.md"](scripts/format/Comic_Script_Format.md:10-13)
  - I2: LSD reveals patterns/illusions; show vendor exception and comm barriers; deepen flicker cues. ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:61-74)
  - I3: Telepathy formalizes; Nicole returns; biergarten stakeout shows overlapping perceptions. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
  - I4: Festival-wide chaos; friendships strained; prep for wave/climax. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
  - I5: Paul finale; telepathic wave resolves mass disruption; ambiguous victory; Red Guy exit. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
- Align beat sheets: consult and lock ["Series_Outline.md"](outline/Series_Outline.md) and per-issue beat sheets (["Issue01_BeatSheet.md"](outline/Issue01_BeatSheet.md), ["Issue02_BeatSheet.md"](outline/Issue02_BeatSheet.md), ["Issue03_BeatSheet.md"](outline/Issue03_BeatSheet.md), ["Issue04_BeatSheet.md"](outline/Issue04_BeatSheet.md), ["Issue05_BeatSheet.md"](outline/Issue05_BeatSheet.md)).

8) Missions and Procedurals (Operational Model)
- Mission framework from originals:
  - Destroy/neutralize corrupted elements: poisoned biergarten beer; brewery adjacencies; acts influenced by “evil”. ["Festival_Missions.md"](docs/missions/Festival_Missions.md:1-11)
  - Corral objective: trap most drunk attendees inside the biergarten as containment to limit spread/harm. ["Festival_Missions.md"](docs/missions/Festival_Missions.md:1-11)
  - Protect friends and fans; preserve access to key sets; end goal: make Paul McCartney. ["Festival_Missions.md"](docs/missions/Festival_Missions.md:1-11)
- Success criteria per issue:
  - I1: Confirm beer threat diegetically via POV-switch beats without authorial exposition. ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:125-134)
  - I2–I3: Test corral/containment; validate vendor exception; map crowd flows. ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:61-74)
  - I4–I5: Execute festival-wide intervention and telepathic wave; land ambiguous win with clean-normal lens counterpoints. ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)

9) Visual Direction and Style
- Script-format guardrails:
  - PAGE/Panel headers; concise panel actions; dialogue/captions/SFX labeling; keep critical art notes only (camera/mood/motion). ["Comic_Script_Format.md"](scripts/format/Comic_Script_Format.md:1-9)
  - POV tags: explicitly mark “Matt POV” for clean rendering; allow stylized overlays in Dreamteam POV panel notes. ["Comic_Script_Format.md"](scripts/format/Comic_Script_Format.md:10-13)
- Issue #1 confirmations:
  - Trippy overlays on Molly night and biergarten silhouettes; lightning/storm as rhythm device; Red Guy card as recurring prop/motif. ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:16-25), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:36-38), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:108-114), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:129-134)

10) Script Standards and Pipeline
- Use the house format: page/panel headers, explicit tags for POV, restrained art notes, and short balloons. ["Comic_Script_Format.md"](scripts/format/Comic_Script_Format.md:1-13)
- Production workflow pointers: finalize Issue #1 script after locking ambiguity policy and beat sheet alignment; then produce sample pages and coordination materials for artists. See production notes in the Bible page. ["index.html"](web/index.html), ["Production_Plan.md"](production/Production_Plan.md)

11) Supplemental Materials Strategy (Watchmen‑style Extras)
- Categories and stubs:
  - Maps & Setlists (per-day), Diaries/Notes (Greg’s LSD scribbles; Sam & Dani entries), Survival Tips (Adam), In-World Ephemera (vendor flyers, “Missing Nicole,” brewery promos, minimal incident/security logs). ["Supplemental_Materials_Plan.md"](docs/extras/Supplemental_Materials_Plan.md:1-7)
  - Concrete stubs to create:
    - maps/Day01_Map.md; maps/Day05_Map.md; setlists/Day01_Setlist.md; setlists/Day05_Setlist.md; survival/Survival_Tips.md. ["Supplemental_Materials_Plan.md"](docs/extras/Supplemental_Materials_Plan.md:8-25)
- Purpose: externalize geography/timeline/tone, reinforce ambiguity (diegetic vs. in-world author), seed clues without breaking POV discipline. ["index.html"](web/index.html)

12) Legal/Collaboration (Draft Template)
- Collaboration template includes basic terms: parties, scope, ownership/credits, compensation (TBD), schedule, deliverables, dispute resolution, signatures. Use as a starting point—non-binding draft. ["Collaboration_Agreement_Template.md"](legal/Collaboration_Agreement_Template.md)
- Recommendation: Convert to a formal agreement once team roles, compensation, and schedules are decided.

13) Gap Analysis and Open Questions
- Ambiguity policy edges (High priority):
  - When can we show “corruption” without collapsing ambiguity? Formalize a one-page rule sheet that states: any sinister cue must be accompanied (within 1–2 pages) by a normal-lens counterpoint or plausible alternative reading. Owners: writing/art. Sources to align: ["Comic_Script_Format.md"](scripts/format/Comic_Script_Format.md:10-13), ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:86-95), ["index.html"](web/index.html)
- Vendor/cashier exception scope (High):
  - Current depiction shows vendor speaking normally during trip; define if this is universal (all retail/counter roles) or contingent (certain spaces). Owner: writing. Source touchpoint: ["Issue01_Script_Sample.md"](scripts/issue-01/Issue01_Script_Sample.md:61-74)
- Telepathy onset and limits (Medium):
  - Specify exact trigger timing (Issue 3 start vs. midpoint), range (line-of-sight vs. proximity), and costs (fatigue?). Owner: writing. Source: ["Series_Treatment.md"](docs/treatment/Series_Treatment.md:8-13)
- Biergarten corral mechanics (Medium):
  - Define believable logistics (fencing, wristbands, staff reaction) to avoid plot-armor. Owner: writing/production. Source: ["Festival_Missions.md"](docs/missions/Festival_Missions.md:1-11)
- Beat sheets consolidation (High):
  - Lock ["Series_Outline.md"](outline/Series_Outline.md) and per-issue beat sheets (I1–I5) to match the finalized ambiguity rules and mission success criteria.
- Setting depth (Medium):
  - Expand ["Firedog_Setting.md"](docs/setting/Firedog_Setting.md) with precise map layers for extras and staging: storm-risk zones, thicket path gates, biergarten ingress, silent disco boundaries, food truck row, main-stage approach.
- Legal specifics (Medium):
  - Ownership split, credit order, per-page rates/revenue splits, milestone calendar, and dispute venue. Source: ["Collaboration_Agreement_Template.md"](legal/Collaboration_Agreement_Template.md)
