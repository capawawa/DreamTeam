## Narrative Structure — Two Stories, One Book

- Source note: "2 stories one book" and "Personal feelings and memories and emotions like an autobiography between pages of graphics and superheroes. Two separate worlds or two in the same. Same emotions feelings and everything just different content."

### Approach
- Interleave autobiographical reflections (Adam’s perspective: feelings, memories, real festival beats) between graphic/superhero sequences (heightened, psychedelic confrontations and missions).
- Maintain parallel emotional arcs: the same emotions and truths are expressed in both modes, though the content and imagery differ.

### Opening Sequence Order (from source notes)
1) Festival map and setlist
2) Group photo
3) Cars packed and driving to Firedog

### POV Discipline
- Autobiographical pages: cleaner layouts, grounded visuals, minimal distortion.
- Superhero pages: stylized, psychedelic overlays, surreal motifs, ambiguous threats.
