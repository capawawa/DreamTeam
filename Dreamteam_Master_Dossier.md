## The Dreamteam Chronicles: Festival of Shadows (Firedog Edition)

### Logline
A 20-friend convoy hits the five-day Firedog Festival in The Woodlands (Delaware, June). A shady brewery’s festival-only beer begins twisting crowds into zombie-like shells while an enigmatic Red Guy’s LSD lets the five-person Dreamteam glimpse a darker layer of reality. Between storm-wrecked campsites, silent discos, food trucks, and a Paul McCartney finale, the Dreamteam fights (or hallucinates) a creeping evil centered on the biergarten—risking everything to save the festival and make the show.

### Core Premise
- The Dreamteam drinks Molly water the first night in the thicket and perceives the festival’s “true nature.”
- Greg takes acid the next day; instead of the same powers, he gets knowledge/insight into how to stop the corruption.
- The festival beer (official biergarten) is tainted; staff feel malevolent; fans become corrupted/zombified.
- The group’s mission across the festival: expose/neutralize the beer, disrupt corrupted acts/areas, save friends, and still see Paul McCartney’s set.
- Two-stories-one-book structure: autobiographical feelings/memories between pages of graphic, superhero-like adventure.

### Canon Rules (Perception, Communication, Ambiguity)
- Perception while high:
  - People on psychedelics: appear magical/caricatured—their “true self.”
  - Sober people: appear normal.
  - Drunk people (festival beer): appear as zombies/monsters.
- Communication barrier while high:
  - Can communicate almost psychically with others who are high.
  - Cannot communicate with sober or drunk people—exceptions: vendors/cashiers and staff behind counters (e.g., food trucks, merch), and Matt when he pops up.
- Telepathy while high: near-psychic coordination among trippers (used for rescue/strategy and comedy).
- Ambiguity policy:
  - No definitive villain monologue/omniscient proof; all “evil” seen via the Dreamteam’s possibly unreliable POV.
  - Optional fleeting glimpses (e.g., shady keg hookups) are always interpretable as either real or hallucination.

### Setting: Firedog Festival (Inspired by Firefly 2014)
- Location: The Woodlands (near Delaware college campus). June dates.
- Storm night: heavy wind/rain; tents flying; muddy grounds; car shelter; adds chaos and visuals.
- Multi-stage festival vibe (10am–1am): EDM lasers, rock, rap, jam bands; silent disco; vendor/brand pop-ups; food trucks; hammock zones.
- Biergarten: single official alcohol vendor (sponsored by a shady brewery) inside festival grounds; outside alcohol not allowed inside.

### Characters
- Core Dreamteam (5):
  - Greg (“Star Child”): gains insight from LSD; acrostic identity G.R.E.G. = Grand Ruler of Ethereal Galaxies; drifts into traps, needs teammates to keep him on-mission.
  - Sam: fun party girl; alternative model; energetic; social scout/intel.
  - Dani (Danielle): older, chill hippie; least spoken, most wise/intuitive; grounding presence.
  - Nick Braswell: big, calm “teddy bear”; Seth Rogen-like laugh; rolls the best blunts; morale backbone and muscle.
  - Adam Blade Capuana: overalls + bucket hat; artistic/creative observer; narrator voice and on-the-ground organizer.
- Extended group (15 others):
  - Nicole: missing for ~24 hours; reappears later (phone dead, lost, muddy)—subplot adds tension and realism.
  - Matt: sober (weed only) friend; pops up randomly; when present, the world reads “normal”; uniquely understandable to the Dreamteam while high.
  - Others: drift between tents/stages; occasional cameos, calls for help, or comedic beats.

### The Man in Red (User-Stated Facts Only)
- Appearance (explicitly stated across notes): red top hat; red hat; red jacket/coat; red shorts; curly mustache; carries a cane and at times a red umbrella.
- Behavior:
  - Appears suddenly (e.g., at the tent), offers drugs, hands a business card that says “Call me!” with a phone number; vanishes.
  - On the phone warns: “Be careful, this is 100% pure.” A test kit turns pure black (100% purity) when checked.
  - In-story, can supply Molly; acid is “only from him” (special to him).
  - Optional rhyme (user-provided):
    - “What do you need I’m got it on me never for free but always in 3
      There’s some weed some molly and blow
      Shrooms and African toad, some LSD but that’s for me. What else did you want to know? You can call me at 3 4675320 0, but really I do have to go”

  - Arrival; five tents in a row; opening visuals: map, setlist, group photo; cars to Firedog.
  - Night one Molly water in the thicket; first “true nature” glimpses.
  - Biergarten weirdness; staff feel off; attendee collapses/acts wrong after beer—reader understands by the end: the beer is the problem.
  - Storm hits: tents flying, mud, car shelter; Nicole last seen headed out; Red Guy cameo + card.
- Issue #2: Day Two – Suspicious Brews & New Highs
  - Group processes beer suspicion; Nicole missing; vendors/cashiers remain communicative exception.
  - Red Guy reached via card; Molly and (ultimately) acid from him.
  - First LSD sequences: shadows/tentacles at beer lines; minor confrontation; ambiguity intact.
- Issue #3: Day Three – Psychic Connections & Biergarten Beats
  - Nicole reappears (muddy/beat, phone dead), mentions biergarten weirdness.
  - Telepathy among trippers; can’t talk to sober/drunk (except Matt/vendors).
  - Biergarten stakeout: illusions of black ooze, flickering eyes; Matt’s sober POV looks normal.
- Issue #4: Day Four – Descent into Drunken Chaos
  - Festival-wide escalation; “drunk zombies” near beer; stage skirmishes; silent disco weirdness; food-truck regroupings.
  - Attempted sabotage/infiltration of biergarten; big strobe-lit clash in mud; friendships strained; resolve hardens for finale.
- Issue #5: Day Five – The Grand Finale (Paul McCartney)
  - Final-day “specials” push beer; massive crowd.
  - Dreamteam funnels telepathy/positive wave; disrupts biergarten flow; Matt’s accidental normal-world intervention creates an opening.
  - Dark aura (or mass hysteria) dissipates; Paul plays on; Red Guy tips hat; uncertainty endures.

### Subplots & Set Pieces (From User Notes)
- Nicole’s 24-hour disappearance: search/callbacks; comedic/unnerving re-entry.
- Silent disco: comedic background cameo (guy digging under the fence), eerie channel with chant-like track.
- Storm montage: tent chaos; group bonds in cars; muddy aftermath complicates everything.
- Hammock and art zones: chill interludes; trippy illusions; chance encounters.
- Vendors/brand pop-ups: clues, freebies, cross-promo with the brewery; comedic transitions.

### Theme & Tone Targets
- Friendship and camaraderie amid chaos.
- Perception vs reality (LSD, Molly, alcohol) and festival-scale ambiguity.
- “Kick their asses, blow up the beer” energy without on-panel killing; outcomes remain mysterious.
- Visual influence: stylized, Scott Pilgrim–esque with psychedelic overlays; Matt’s panels are clean/grounded.

### Opening Visuals Plan
- First pages: festival map and day’s setlist; then group photo; then convoy to Firedog.

### Supplemental Materials Plan (Per-Issue Extras)
- Festival maps (day-by-day; track storm/mud changes).
- Setlists/schedules (with comedic band names; Day 5 shows Paul McCartney).
- Character diaries/notes (Greg’s LSD scribbles; Sam & Dani entries).
- “Festival Survival Tips” (Adam voice; practical + comedic).
- In-world ephemera: vendor flyers, “Missing Nicole” poster, brewery promos, modest incident/security logs.

### Notes on Paul McCartney & Licensing Positioning
- Named in-story as the headliner (autobiographical cameo).
- Portrayed as largely unaware of the chaos; seen from crowd/stage POV.

### One-Page Summary (For Quick Orientation)
- Go-to hook: Five-day festival; tainted biergarten beer; Red Guy’s LSD grants sight; Dreamteam fights to save the festival and still make Paul.
- Experience pillars: storm-night chaos; silent disco oddities; food trucks; hammock/art zones; brand pop-ups; multi-stage day-night cycle.
- Core conflicts: protect friends; dismantle biergarten influence; preserve ambiguity: real evil vs epic group trip.
- End state: festival saved (maybe); lesson is friendship, perception, and a wild shared odyssey.
